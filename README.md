 Marketing Conversion Analysis: Facebook vs Google AdWords
 Project Overview

This project presents a data-driven comparison between Facebook Ads and Google AdWords to determine which platform generates a higher number of conversions.

The analysis was developed as part of a data analytics capstone-style project and focuses on applying descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and simple linear regression to support marketing decision-making.

The final outcome provides actionable insights to optimize advertising budget allocation and improve return on investment (ROI).

 Business Context

BrightThreads invests in paid digital advertising across multiple platforms, including Facebook and Google AdWords. Management aims to identify which platform performs better in terms of conversions in order to make informed decisions about future budget distribution.

Business Question:

Which advertising platform generates more conversions and should receive a higher budget allocation?

 Datasets Used

This project uses two datasets, both included in this repository:

 Capstone Dataset (Capstone Dataset.xlsx)

Main dataset containing campaign-level information, including:

Advertising platform (Facebook / AdWords)

Ad clicks

Ad views

Conversions

Cost-related metrics (CPC, CTR, cost per ad)

This dataset was used for:

Descriptive statistics

Distribution analysis

Hypothesis testing

Regression modeling

2️ Calculations Dataset (calculations.xlsx)

Supporting dataset used for:

Aggregated metrics

Frequency tables

Summary calculations

Statistical results validation

 Methodology

The analysis followed a structured data analytics workflow:

Data understanding and variable classification

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using frequency tables and histograms

Correlation analysis between clicks and conversions

Hypothesis testing to compare conversion performance

Simple linear regression to model the relationship between variables

 Key Analyses Performed
Descriptive Statistics

Average ad clicks: 60.38

Average AdWords conversions: 5.98

Average Facebook conversions: 11.74

Conversions showed low variability (σ = 1.62), indicating consistent performance

Frequency Analysis

Most campaigns generated between 6 and 10 conversions

No high-end outliers above 15 conversions

Correlation Analysis

Correlation coefficient between clicks and conversions: 0.44

Indicates a moderate positive relationship

Hypothesis Testing

p-value < 0.05

Statistically significant difference between platforms

Facebook shows higher average conversions than AdWords

Regression Model

Simple linear regression used to evaluate the relationship between clicks and conversions

Model supports exploratory and explanatory analysis

 Key Insights

Facebook outperforms Google AdWords in terms of average conversions

The difference is statistically significant

Increased ad engagement (clicks) is associated with increased conversions

 Recommendations

Allocate a larger portion of the advertising budget to Facebook campaigns

Incorporate cost per conversion in future analyses

Segment results by audience type and time period for deeper insights
